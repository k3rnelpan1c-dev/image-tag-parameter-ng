== Introduction
Image Tag Parameter NG (Next Generation) is a re-imagination/-implementation of the original link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/image-tag-parameter-plugin[Image Tag Parameter (by maduma)].
To answer why I did not simply add to that project, I wanted to try writing a Kotlin based Jenkins plugin and rewriting a plugin completely and getting your PR merged seemed impossible :wink:.

Based on this the plugins should have feature party (once I am done), with te exception to the language they were written in.
